Lunakey Pico is a 40% keyboard which has 44 keys and is splitted to left and right. Each side has 3 rows x 6 columns and 4 keys that are pressed by a thumb. Also, it has an ability to light up by Underglow LEDs on the bottom and an ability to play a sound by a speaker module. Of course, the column-staggered key layout is the result of deep thinking to fit each finger and each key naturally.
